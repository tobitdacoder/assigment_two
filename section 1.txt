1. the output for this code: ''' 
x=5
y=3
print(x%y)
'''   will be: 2


2. the purpose of a loop in programming is:  to repeat a set of statements multiple time.

3. the difference between a list and a tuple is that tuples are immutable (they can no longer been externaly modified by any function after they are created) and
   list are mutable (which means that we can delete,add or append,modify the content of it after it has been created)

4. the output of this program ''' 
x=5
y=10

if x>y:
   print("x is greater than y")
else:
   print("x is less than or equal to y")
''' is: "x is less than or equal to y"

5.  the purpose of a function in programming is :To break a large program into smaller, reusable components

6. in the list: function,print,if,variable, the python keywords are: print and if

7. ''' 
x=[1,2,3]
x.append(4)
print(x)
'''   the output here is [1, 2, 3, 4]

8. the purpose of the return statement is: To return a value from the function to the caller.

9. '''
x=2
y=3
z=x*y
print(z)
'''  the output of our program is 6.

10. the purpose of a comment in python code is To explain the purpose or function of a 
specific line or section of code.
